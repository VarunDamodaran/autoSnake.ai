# Snake Game with Reinforcement Learning

This project implements a classic Snake game where the snake learns to play optimally using the Deep Q-Network (DQN) technique. The project demonstrates the use of reinforcement learning to teach the snake to navigate the game environment efficiently.

## Introduction

The Snake game is a classic arcade game where the player controls a snake to eat food and grow longer while avoiding collisions with the walls and its own tail. In this project, we employ the Deep Q-Network (DQN) technique to teach the snake to play the game optimally.

## Features

- Implementation of the classic Snake game.
- Reinforcement learning using the DQN technique.
- Training and evaluation modes.
- Live visualization of the snake's learning process.
